# Challenges

For the first challenge we created an algorithm to find top 5 bots with the most CPU usage.
- Output: 249452, 211131, 202577, 202269, 201520

For the second challenge we printed how many securities each bot inspected after two rounds.
- Output: Bot Alan: 12, Bot Anna: 11, Bot Turing: 8, Bot Ada: 7, Bot Lovelace: 4


The third challenge is the same as the second one except for five thousand rounds. Using the same code from the previous challange, the program freezes after 7 or 8 rounds. This is because, we kept squaring the same number in each round which beame exponentially more computationally expensive since the number kept becoming larger.
To overcome this problem, we developed a solution involving prime factors such that we dont have to square it each time.


Bonus Challange:
We created an algorthim that graphically represents how each of the bots trade with each other.
